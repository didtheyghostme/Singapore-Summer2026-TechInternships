### 🧠 What makes it different?

With this, you can:

- ✅ Track your application and see how others fared for the same role  
- ✅ View when companies usually send replies, reject, or ghost  
- ✅ Explore real user-submitted online assessments and interview rounds  
- ✅ Ask questions and discuss job postings with other applicants  
- ✅ Report if a role has closed, and see when companies stop hiring  

It’s more than a job board — it’s a transparent job-hunting companion.
